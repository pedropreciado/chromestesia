Chromestesia is a simple to use, single page application designed for musicians. It is a songwriting tool, inspired by the metronome, that uses audio and visuals to help musicians maintain timing and tempo. The colors selected are used by the musician to maintain a certain theme while composing a song.

[Chromesthesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromesthesia) is a type of synesthesia is which heard sounds automatically and involuntarily evoke an experience of color.

Users will have the ability to select a color or set of colors which will then be rendered in time with the tempo and time signature they selected.

Chromestesia was built using the following technologies and libraries:
+ Vanilla JavaScript ES6 for DOM Manipulation
+ HTML5 Canvas for drawing
+ `jquery-wheelcolorpicker` for color selection
+ `intro.js` for each feature's description.

## Functionality and Implementation

### Tempo and Color Picker

Users can select from a variety of colors and hues for every beat. The colors will then be displayed in full screen, along with audio feedback. Users will have the option to mute and unmute the metronome. The users will also be able to bring up the form and adjust their colors with the space bar, for quick adjustments.
